                                I am a physicist that after almost 3 years working for an IT consulting Firm in banking projects, using cobol as a main language,
                                I decided to move to Australia to learn english and explore other countries.
                                after some years of learning other fields, i am exited to go back to the coding world and learn new technoligies and languages for me.
                                I have strong problem-solving skills and an analytic mind that leads me to be organized and meet the required time lines for
                                every project I am part of, professionaly and in my personal life.
                                My goal is to develop my knowledge and skills to make a career as a full stack developer
                                and return to an IT role.
